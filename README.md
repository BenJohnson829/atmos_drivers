# Atmos Drivers (atmos)drivers)

Atmos Drivers is the driver of the [FMS](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS) enabled atmospheric dynamical core used by GFDL.  It depends on the [GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere), and can be used to run with the [FMScoupler](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMScoupler)
